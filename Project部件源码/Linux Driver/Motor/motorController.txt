In this peripheral£¬there are 4 32-bits registers implementing the function of controlling the motors' speed and direction.
For each register,the 31st bit represents enabling bit,and the 30th bit as direction bit.

Correspondence table like below:

 BASEADDR + 0x0     Motor0
 BASEADDR + 0x4     Motor1
 BASEADDR + 0x8     Motor2
 BASEADDR + 0xC     Motor3
